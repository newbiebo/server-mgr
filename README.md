# server-mgr


[README](README.md) | [ä¸­æ–‡æ–‡æ¡£](README_zh.md)

server-mgr is a family private server management application, including flexible resource backup strategy, Apple bark application message notification, email notification, server monitoring, etc.

## why server-mgrï¼Ÿ

Deploy server-mgr on your home server, server-mgr can help you:

* Eliminate the need to buy expensive disk arrays.
* Keep family data safe with minimal resources.
* The bark application message and email will push the server status in real time.
* Server Status Monitoring.
* Provide server management page.
* Support Docker rapid deployment.

## development status

The current version 0.1.0 already supports the local file backup function(Support manual or task).

Subsequent functions will be developed in succession in the future.

Since there is only one person developing the project for the time being, subsequent iterations will be slower, please forgive me.
